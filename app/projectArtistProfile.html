				ReverbNation has a community of independant artists that make up over 8 million visits a month, most of which use the Artist Profile page as their home base for connecting with fans and other musicians. While the app worked for many long-time users, the ability to keep up with competitive products required a newer, responsive interface, that would continue to serve the community and simultaneously entice new users to engage by contributing content and sharing.

				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">We scaled our test group up slowly, starting with about 5% of new users at first. We collected all the responsive in a gmail account that everyone on the team had access to, so we could see feedback come in real time while using Mixpanel to track key metrics like song uploads and shares.</p>

The user is able to toggle to the "Fan View" which strips this layer away to give them a preview of the final product.</p>
