				ReverbNation.com has a community of independent artists and fans that make up over 8 million visits a month. These musicians use the Artist Profile page as their home base for connecting with fans and other musicians. With such a large and active user base, a key for success was continuing to serve the community while simultaneously increasing content contributions, logins, and shares.

			<div class="project-expanded-content">
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">The Artist Profile encourages the user to add and edit content right inline with a contextually relevant UI layer with controls that only the logged in owner of the page will see. The user is able to toggle to the "Fan View" which strips this layer away to give them a preview of the final product.</p>

					Users can upload songs and photos, create shows, link to and present videos, write their bios, add press releases, band members and links to other sites, stores, and social networks. They can also customize their profile by switching up the module order, or turning modules off altogether.
				</p>
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">
					We used Vibrant.JS to detect a highlight color from either the cover photo or the profile picture, and use that to seed certain UI and background colors throughout the profile. The user can override this though.

			<h3>Migrating Legacy Users</h3>
			<div class="project-expanded-content">
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">
					In an attempt to get current profile users onto the new profile, we presented them with the option to opt-in. As part of the opt-in visual, I created a short animation to give the user the idea of us creating a brand new profile for them with their existing content. We started the opt-in offer with just 10% of existing users. Of the first 2000 users to opt in, 95% stayed on the new profile.

			<h3>Testing and Iterating</h3>
			<div class="project-expanded-content">
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">We scaled our test group up slowly, starting with about 5% of new users at first. We collected all the responses in a gmail account that everyone on the team had access to, so we could see qualitative feedback come in real time while using Mixpanel to track key metrics like song uploads and shares.</p>
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">Improvements continue to be made as long term usage is tracked, and support tickets are compiled to identify areas of friction.</p>
