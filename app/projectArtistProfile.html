				ReverbNation has a community of independant artists that make up over 8 million visits a month, most of which use the Artist Profile page as their home base for connecting with fans and other musicians. While the app worked for many long-time users, the ability to keep up with competitive products required a newer, responsive interface, that would continue to serve the community and simultaneously entice new users to engage by contributing content and sharing.

			<h3>Artist Admin</h3>
			<div class="project-expanded-content">
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">The Artist Profile allows the user to add and edit content right inline with a contextually relevant ui layer with controls that only the logged in owner of the page will see. The user is able to toggle to the "Fan View" which strips this layer away to give them a preview of the final product.</p>

					Users can upload songs and photos, create shows, link to and present videos, write their bios, add press releases, band members and links to other sites, stores, and social networks. They can also customize their profile by switching up the module order, or turning modules off altogether.
				</p>
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">
					We use Vibrant.JS to detect a highlight color from either the cover photo or the profile picture, and use that to seed certain UI and background colors throughout the profile. The user can override this though.

			<h3>Testing and Iterating</h3>
			<div class="project-expanded-content">
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">We scaled our test group up slowly, starting with about 5% of new users at first. We collected all the responses in a gmail account that everyone on the team had access to, so we could see feedback come in real time while using Mixpanel to track key metrics like song uploads and shares.</p>
				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">Improvements continue to be made as long term usage is tracked, and support tickets are compiled to identify areas of friction.</p>
