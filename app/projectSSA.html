				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">I designed this tool to make clear what is normally esoteric and convoluted. I simplified the process of finding, comparing, saving, and sharing geospatial data related to cell towers, down to a single screen interface where the most important content, the map and data layers, are always visible.</p>

			<h3>UI Development</h3>

				<p class="project-expanded-text-only">
					Part of simplifying a complex process for people is allowing for flexibility. When creating the front end of this application, I made sure to cater to the very human tendency to experiment, and try things out in different ways. The other side of the problem is enabling this behavior from the application's perspective. One of the methods I used to accomplish this early on was implementing a simple Pub / sub, observer pattern system for event management to keep track of and update the id attribute of input fields as the user creates and deletes them.
